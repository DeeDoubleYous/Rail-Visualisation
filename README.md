The client and middleware app for the entire Rail-Vis project. Needed to run is credentials for api.rtt.io, a key for the Google Directions Api and the key for the statistics server. 

App can be found at https://railvisualisation20220417135102.azurewebsites.net

Running the app is as easy as opening in the latest Visual Studio, ensuring the app.config is populated with the correct credentials and pressing run.
